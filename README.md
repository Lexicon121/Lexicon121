🌟 Hi there! I'm Lexie Thach 🚀. Over the last 10 years, I've explored cyber, tech, and development, from IT analyst roles 🖥️ to purple teaming 🟣 and beyond. I've shared my experiences at local meet-ups 📢 and on the grand stage of DEFCON 🛡️! My passions include autonomous systems like drones 🚁, robotics 🤖, ICS/SCADA systems 🏭, AI and ML 🧠, and recently, satellite and orbital technology 🌌.
